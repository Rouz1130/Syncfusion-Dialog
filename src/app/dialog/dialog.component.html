		Facebook is an online social networking service headquartered in Menlo Park, California. Its website was launched on February
		4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg with his Harvard College roommates and fellow students Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin
		Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students, but later
		expanded it to colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University. It gradually added support for students
		at various other universities and later to high-school students.
